![Rounded Polygon Showcase Screenshot](https://github.com/robert-leitl/material-you-rounded-polygon/blob/main/screenshot.png?raw=true)

This repository contains an angular 12 application which implements a simple 
directive that draws a rounded svg polygon which gets applied as a clip-path to the host element.
The directive can be used to the rounded polygon shapes as they are used by the material you theme ([Material You Announcement](https://material.io/blog/announcing-material-you)).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
